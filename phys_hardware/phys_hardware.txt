Power Supply Read Me doc

The power supply portion of the Automatic Core tester is a highly complex and intricate 
piece of hardware that was meticulously and continually tested.  The buck-boost converter
is capable of 10V to 1200V output from a 48V-240V input voltage.  The operational details
of an inverting buck-boost converter are best described according to this wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckâ€“boost_converter
along with relevant equations about duty cycle and output ripple.

Relevant source files/software:
Casing design - CAD file enclosing the PCB and AC-DC converters that allows for adequate
air flow.  Will need Autodesk Fusion 360 to operate.  See below for download details


Buck-Boost Simulink model - simulated buck boost design with adjustable output loads and 
duty cycle.  Also allows for modification of inductor and capacitor layout along with 
values.  Values and outputs are linked to the live script in the Matlab directory.   
Will need Simulink and Matlab software to operate. See below for download details
