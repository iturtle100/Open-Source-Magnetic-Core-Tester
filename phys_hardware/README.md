# Power System

## Overview

The hardware of this project is open for variation and redesign.  The capability of the buck boost converter should have an output range form 10-1200V 
from an input range of 48-240V.  The input voltage can be modulated by a closed loop feedback loop from a voltage sensor on the output.  The input voltage 
comes from the combination of 5 AC DC converters that can be purchased from the parts lists outlined in the physical hardware section.

  - Product should be a self contained box that can simply plug into the wall
  - Parts could be back ordered depending on availablility
  - PCB construciton should be conducted by experienced professionals
  - Voltage ranges should be moderated for the environment in which the experience is taking place
  
 The product is open source so should be open for modificaiton
 
 Good luck!
